# Uninformative Error in MATLAB Function
This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon MATLAB error where the error message is not very informative, making it difficult to debug. The error occurs within a function and might stem from issues like array indexing or other subtle coding problems.  The solution provides improvements for better error handling and clarity.

## Bug
The primary issue is the lack of specific details in the error message, making it challenging to identify the root cause.  This is a common problem when exceptions are not properly handled.

## Solution
The solution focuses on enhancing error handling within the MATLAB function to provide more context-rich error messages, which are crucial for efficient debugging.
